      <h1>Material and Construction</h1>
		<div id="active"></div>
			<div id="article-display">
        <p>The orante statues were made of red clay and are hollow inside.  The artist began building the basic conical shape of the body from the bottom up with small rectangular pieces of clay joined together by pressing with the hands.  Three large holes were left in this conical structure, two for the arms and one for the head.  The arms and head were made separately and attached to the body later.  
        </p>
        <p> To facilitate the joining of arms and head to the body a rectangular window was cut into the back so that the artist could reach in and up.  It is possible that this window also served as a vent hole during firing.
        </p>
        <p> The arms were made by rolling a slab of clay onto itself and joining it at the edge lengthwise.  On the left is an arm fragment of the orante with the arm folded over her belly showing this construction technique.  The hands and fingers were made separately from the arms and attached.  
        </p>
        <p>The head was made in two halves using a two-piece mold and then joined.  Researchers have determined that only five molds were used to produce all the heads of over forty existing orante statues.  The next step was to shape the neck from a slab of clay, which allowed the head to be connected to the body.  
        </p>
        <p> Details such as the pupils and lids of the eyes, and the ears were individually modeled and attached.  The part and lines in the hair, and the folds in the neck were made by incising with pointed modeling tools.  Finally, any additional sections of hair like locks or a ponytail were free-formed and attached to the back of the neck and shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>The shoes were also modeled separately and attached to the body.  This detail from the underside of the orante with the raised arms shows the left shoe protruding from underneath the long garment.  
        </p>
        <p>The folds of the garment were made with rolls and strips of clay pressed against the basic conical shape of the body and smoothed out to achieve a continuous surface.  This technique is clearly visible on the underside of the statues.  
        <br />The folds in the garment do not typically extend to the back.  Most orantes are not decorated on the back side suggesting that they were only meant to be seen from the front.  One of the final step in the assembly of an orante was the application of the belt, which was shaped separately from a band of clay.  Not all orantes have a belt, for example, the orante with the arm folded over her belly does not have one.
        </p>
        <p>Three holes along the bottom of the garment ??one in the front and two in the back??were made by cutting with a sharp tool from the outside in.  The function of the holes is believed to be either for inserting poles used for carrying the statue in the funerary procession or for inserting pegs or ropes to secure the statues  for stability purposes (for example, on a processional carrying platform).
        <br />Once the clay had fully dried the statue was fired at about 1000??C.  A sculpture that is made of fired clay is called a terracotta, which gets its name from the Italian for ??baked earth??.?  
        </p>
        <p>After firing, the artist applied to the surface a layer of pure white clay known as kaolin, which served as a base layer to paint the orantes in bright colors.  The colors ranged from hot pinks, reds, browns to black.  In most cases, these colors have not survived.   The details shown here are from an orante at the Archaeological Museum in Naples (Inv. 22296), which is a rare example of a statue with traces of original paint on the face and garment.
