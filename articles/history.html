      <h1>History of Orantes at the Museum</h1>
		<div id="active"></div>
			<div id="article-display">
        <p>During the reinstallation of the Worcester Art Museum??s Greek Gallery in 1995, the newly hired curator of ancient art discovered the orante with the arm across her stomach??broken in many pieces?? in storage, where it had languished since its purchase in 1927.  The Museum??s archive revealed that the orante was purchased along with a second one (the orante with raised arms) from a London dealer (see photos on the left). The orantes were shipped from London and upon arrival the orante with the arm across her stomach was found to have broken in transit. 
        A review of related correspondence from the 1920s revealed that the museum director at the time, George Eggers, had a particular installation in mind involving the figures as a pair. However, the damage done in transit prevented this scenario and instead, the intact orante was de-accessioned in 1946 and sold at auction in New York at Parke-Bernet Galleries Inc., a prominent auction house that was later purchased by Sotheby??s in 1964.  
        In 2008??while the conservator was in the midst of conserving the broken orante that had remained at the Museum and had lingered in storage for decades??the Museum contacted Sotheby??s to inquire about the 1946 sale of the second orante.  In an amazing instance of serendipity they discovered that the same orante that had been sold in 1946 had been offered the week before to Sotheby??s for auction by an art dealer in Tasmania (Australia). 
        </p>
        <p>The Museum arranged to purchase the orante directly from the art dealer and bypass the auction.  After more than six decades, eight different owners, multiple restoration campaigns, and a trip half-way around the world, the orante with the raised arms was reunited with its former companion at the Worcester Art Museum. The picture on the left shows the orante being unpacked from its crate after its return to the Museum in 2008.
