				<p>	Dozens of underground tombs dating from the fourth to the first centuries BCE have been discovered in and around the town of Canosa (Canusium).  Often consisting of several rooms or chambers decorated with wall painting, these tombs contained the remains of the deceased accompanied by orante statues and rich grave goods.  Most of these tombs were excavated by local inhabitants motivated by monetary gain in the nineteenth and early twentieth century prior to the establishment of modern archeological practices.  The tomb contents were sold usually without leaving any records indicating where the artifacts went.</p>
				<p> Many of these tombs like the Scocchera B tomb still exist today—and some can even be
					visited—but they are empty of the grave goods left by the ancient citizens of Canusium.
					Discovered in 1895 under an almond grove on the eastern outskirts of Canosa, this tomb
					received the name of its landowner, Mr. Scocchera. The Scocchera tomb complex is
					unusual because—thanks to a publication from 1898, which includes some photographs
					and a list of objects—we know much more about it than about most of the other tombs.
					<br />
					To enter this six-chambered underground tomb one first has to pass through a hallway, the
					dromos.
				</p>
				<p> From the end of this hallway three chambers open off to three sides, and the central one
					in turn gives access to three more chambers. The tomb floor plan can be seen here on the
					left. Based on the 1898 publication we know that in the rear left chamber (see skull on
					tomb plan) the only skeleton in the tomb was discovered. We also know that several pieces
					of fine jewelry were found amongst the bones, a fact that suggests that the skeleton was
					probably that of a woman, and that therefore the tomb was that of a wealthy lady.
				</p>
				<p> According to the 1898 publication the largest objects discovered in this tomb were
					eight orante statues. Unfortunately, photographs of only three of them are in the 1898
					publication, and their exact location in the tomb is not mentioned. These three orantes
					are now at the National Museum of Denmark, the Antiquities Museum of Rouen and the
					Archaeological Museum of Bari.
				</p>
				<p> During their extensive research in preparation for this exhibition Worcester Art Museum
					conservators learned that according to modern scholarly research the orante statue with
					the raised arms in this exhibition was one of the eight orantes found in the Scocchera B
					tomb.
