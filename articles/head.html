      <h1>Why is the head missing?</h1>

        <p>The recent conservation of the two Worcester orantes included investigations into what parts are original and what are post-excavation restorations.  Some of these investigations were prompted by visual inconsistencies noted by the curator and conservators.  For example, the head of the orante with its arm across the stomach appeared proportionally too small for the body, particularly when compared to other orantes (fragments of this orante can be seen on the left).  
        </p>
        <p>This inconsistency is evident when the orante with raised arms (the head of which is original) is compared with an old photograph of the orante with the suspect head??taken before it broke in transit from London to Worcester soon after it was purchased in 1926.  Further inconsistencies were evident in the way the break edges between the body and the suspect head did not line up, as well as the differences in appearance between the terracotta of the head and other parts of the statue.  
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, when conservators studied the suspect head they also noticed striking resemblances to other orantes, both in style and fabrication technique.  X-radiographs (on the left) revealed that the head was made in a two-piece mold, just like all the other orante heads (note the black vertical line where both halves were joined).  One possible explanation for the similarities with other orantes is that the mold used to make it was taken from an existing orante.  If that is the case, the smaller size of the head is likely the result of the shrinking that occurs with clay during drying and firing. The restorer responsible for making this head did not account for the shrinkage rate of clay, which ranges from 4% to over 15% depending on the clay type.
        </p>
        <p>To confirm that the head was probably a restoration, small samples were taken of it and a fragment from the arm thought to be original and sent for thermo luminescence analysis to determine the likely firing date of each.  The results (see report on the left) showed that the firing date of the head (Sample A) was calculated to have been less than 200 years ago, whereas the fragment from the arm (Sample C) was calculated to have been fired between 1400 and 2300 years ago, confirming that the head is indeed a modern restoration and the arm is ancient. The report also shows the result of a sample taken from the back (sample B).  
        <br />After determining that the disproportionate head was a modern restoration, it was decided to display the orante without the head.  Displaying the orante alongside two other orantes with original heads, helps the viewer to imagine what the head may have looked like in Antiquity. The restoration head is now in storage and serves as a document of the statue??s post-excavation history.
