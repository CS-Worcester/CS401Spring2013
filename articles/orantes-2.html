				<p>	With arms opened and raised as if in prayer this orante exemplifies the most common gesture among statues of this type. One arm is slightly higher than the other.  This statue stands with the left leg bent and the knee protruding supporting its weight on the right foot.  The head is tilted slightly to the right side.  The wavy hair is parted in the middle and pulled back covering the top of both ears, and two serpentine locks??parts of which are missing?? rest on the shoulders.  The orante wears a chiton, a full-length sleeveless dress, with an apoptygma, which is an overfall of fabric where the dress is drawn up over a belt that is therefore not visible.   A second belt is tied over the chiton into a bow below the breasts.  The tips of the shoes emerge from under the long dress.  
        </p>
        <p>The back of the statue is not fully modeled and has visible tool marks. A rectangular opening in the lower back served both as an assembly window to attach the head and arms to the body and as a vent hole to prevent cracking or breaking during firing.
        </p>
        <p>Three other orantes exist that are very similar to this one.  The first one is at the National Museum of Copenhagen (Inv. 4995), the second one is at the Antiquities Museum in Rouen (Inv. 1965), and the third one??s whereabouts is not known but it is depicted in an old photograph from the turn of the 20th century kept in a European archive.  The first two, and probably also the third, were found in the Scocchera B tomb and researchers feel strongly that Worcester??s orante was found there as well (see chapter ??Archaeology??). 
        </p>
        <p>This orante has one arm resting across the stomach and the other raised to the chin.  The head is missing as are some fingers, part of the left shoulder and a large part of the back.  The statue wears a full-length sleeveless chiton with an apoptygma, but without an outer belt.  This figure supports its weight on the right foot while the left leg is slightly bent with the knee protruding.  The tips of the shoes are emerging from under the long dress.  
        </p>
        <p>The verso is not fully modeled and tool marks are visible. The rectangular opening in the lower back served as an assembly window to attach the head and arms to the body and as a vent hole during firing.  
        </p>
        <p>This orante's upper arms rest against the body while the forearms are raised slightly upwards and in front of the body.  The right hand is bent upwards with the palm facing down.  The left hand is missing.  The orante stands with the proper left leg slightly bent, and the head is slightly tilted towards the right side.  
        <br />
        The figure wears a full-length sleeveless chiton with a straight neckline and a small amount of fabric falling onto the upper arms.  The chiton has a belt tied into a bow under the chest and an apoptygma.  The tips of her shoes are emerging from under the dress.  
        </p>
        <p>The wavy hair, which is parted in the middle, is pulled back covering the top of both ears and falls into a point down the back.  
        </p>
        <p>When viewed from the side, the figure is leaning backwards and has a slightly rounded belly.  Could this orante represent a pregnant woman?  There are no other known statues that appear to be pregnant.
        </p>
        <p>The verso of the orante is not fully modeled and has visible tool marks.  The opening in the lower back of this orante is oval in shape.  It served as an assembly window to attach the head and arms to the body and as a vent hole during firing.
        </p>
        <p>From a stylistic point of view this orante in this exhibition has many similarities with two orantes at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen (Inv. HIN 419 and Inv. HIN 422): the head and its slight tilt, the small and delicate facial features, the bow on the chiton, and the shape of the hands.
