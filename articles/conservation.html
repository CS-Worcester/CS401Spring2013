        <p>What is Conservation and what do Conservators do?
        <br />A staff of highly-trained conservators is responsible for the preservation of the Worcester Art Museum collections.  Art conservation is a multi-disciplinary profession that combines knowledge of the sciences, fine arts, art history, and archaeology.  Before conservators undertake conservation treatments they carefully examine the object and conduct preliminary research to identify the materials the art object is made of and understand the techniques that were used to make it.  To assist with the examination of museum objects conservators typically make use of scientific instrumentation such as microscopes, high-end cameras, and equipment for various types of technical imaging such as x-radiography and infrared reflectography. Conservators follow strict professional guidelines in their work, including taking measures to assure the reversibility of their treatments and using inert materials that will not harm the art objects.

        <p> The Conservation of the Orante with raised Arms
        <br />Although this statue appeared intact when it arrived in the conservation lab, it was actually broken and extensively restored.  The large and crude hands were modern plaster restorations.  Also, the darkened surface of this figure consisted of accumulated dirt, an applied surface coating, and layers of modern paint.  For more information refer to ??Technical and Scientific Analysis of the Worcester Orantes?? 
        </p>
        <p> These two X-radiographs reveal that the head and arms of the orante were broken in many pieces, and that wire and other hardware were used in the restoration of the arms and fingers.
        </p>
        <p>Using great care not to damage the ancient original parts of the sculpture conservators systematically disassembled the entire statue using tools like micro-chisels, lasers, and chemical solvents.  These pictures show the wire, screws and brackets that were found while disassembling the statue.  Restoration fingers consisting of plaster and wire were also removed.  
        </p>
        <p>After removing all the old restorations the orante was in over 100 pieces.  It was important to remove the old adhesive in the joins since it was not only visibly discolored, but in many cases was no longer strong enough to hold the broken statue together.  
        </p>
        <p>The next stage of treatment was to clean the surface of the fragments using a combination of solvents and the laser, followed by reassembling all the ancient fragments using a conservation-grade adhesive.
        </p>
        <p>The gaps left by missing ancient shards were filled with an inert filling compound and painted in to achieve a visually continuous surface.  
        </p>
        <p>An important rule in the conservation of antiquities is not to restore missing parts of the artwork if shapes and colors have to be invented. This is the reason why parts of the hands, hair, and garment of this orante are missing.
