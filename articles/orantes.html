      <h1>What are Orantes?</h1>
		<div id="active"></div>
			<div id="article-display">
				<p>	Orantes are funerary statues—always of women—that were made exclusively in the South
        Italian town of Canosa during the fourth and third centuries BCE.  The name of these statues
        is derived from the latin verb orare, which means to pray.  The majority of orantes adopt 
        the universal gesture of prayer with the arms lifted, the elbows near the sides of the body,
        and the hands outstretched.  Their head is often tilted and their facial expression is 
        pensive, and filled with sadness and reflection. 
        <br />They are hollow statues made of terracotta.  Unusually large for terracotta figures 
        of this period these statues range in height from 64 cm – 109 cm and they were originally 
        painted in bright colors.  The original colors of the orantes unfortunately have not survived,
        although with some exceptions.</p>				
        <p> Orantes wear the typical dress that women wore in the ancient Greek world over 2,000 years ago.
        All three orantes in this exhibition wear a long sleeveless dress that reaches down to their ankles
        called a chiton.  Real chitons were made of light-weight linen cut longer than the shoulder-to-floor
        measurement of the woman wearing it.  The excess length was pulled up (far left drawing) and tied at 
        the waist with a girdle that was covered by the overfall of fabric known as the apoptygma 
        (near left drawing).  A second belt was then tied below the breasts.  The orantes’ feet—wearing sandals
        or shoes—protrude from underneath the chiton.
				</p>
				<p> While all orantes are depicted wearing a chiton, some are also shown wearing a cloak over the chiton.  
        Cloaks like the ones shown here, are called himations and were heavier and often made of wool.  Himations
        were worn by women in the winter to protect them from the cold.
				</p>
				<p> The hair of the orantes provides further insight into the styles from this period of Antiquity. Their 
        wavy hair is parted in the middle and pulled back over the ears.  On some orantes the hair divides into 
        two or more locks that rest on the shoulders and chest. On others the hair is pulled back in a ponytail
        or a braid. 
				</p>
				<p> Another commonality among orantes is their unique stance that in the visual arts is called 
        contrapposto, an Italian term that means counterpose.  In this stance, most of the figure’s weight is
        shown resting on one foot. While the leg that holds most of the weight is straight, the other one is 
        slightly bent at the knee, which in the case of the orantes, results in a dynamic pattern of folds
        emanating from the left knee.  As an alternative to the static frontal stance of earlier sculpture, 
        contrapposto was an art historical phenomenon that the Greeks invented in the early fifth century. 
        Representing the human figure in contraposto was still considered innovative at the time the orantes were made.
