      <h1>Technical and Scientific Analysis of the Worcester Orantes</h1>
		<div id="active"></div>
			<div id="article-display">
        <p>For a better understanding of the physical and chemical nature of the two orantes that belong to the Worcester Art Museum, technical and scientific analyses were conducted before the conservation treatment began. When analyzing works of artistic and historic importance, conservators and conservation scientists start by using non-invasive, non-destructive techniques that do not require sampling. 
        <br />X-radiography
        One such technique is X-radiography, which was used on the orantes to document the original fabrication techniques, as well as the extent of damage and restoration materials present (see CONSERVATION section). On the left is an X-radiograph of the arms of one of the orantes. The dark lines are areas of breaks that were mended in the past. The lighter lines in one elbow and all fingers are metal wires used in an old restoration.
        </p>
        <p> Ultraviolet-induced visible fluorescence
        <br />Another imaging method often used by conservators involves photographing an object under different lighting conditions. For instance, the appearance of an object when illuminated with ultraviolet (UV) light is often helpful in differentiating original materials from restoration materials. The way some materials fluoresce under UV illumination can also help characterize that material. The photographs shown here are of a multi-shard fragment of one orante glued together in a previous restoration as it appeared under visible light (top) and UV illumination (bottom). The orange fluorescence of the adhesive used in a previous restoration campaign suggests that the adhesive is shellac, a material known to have a distinct orange fluorescence under UV illumination.
        </p>
        <p> Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA)
        <br />To inform conservation treatment strategies and answer remaining questions regarding the relationship of the orantes to one another, additional analyses were conducted that required sampling. One such analysis was NAA, a technique that enables scientists to quantify elements present within a representative sample. The method uses a neutron beam to induce the formation of radioactive isotopes of the elements. The presence and amount of elements in the sample can then be determined by detecting the emissions and radioactive decay of the isotopes.  In the case of the Worcester orantes, small terracotta samples were removed from each and sent for NAA to the Archaeometry Lab at the University of Missouri. NAA showed that the elemental profiles of the two Worcester orantes were statistically indistinguishable from each other at a 95% confidence level. This suggests that the two orantes were made from the same geochemical clay source. 
        </p>
        <p>Cross-section Analysis
        <br />To clearly understand the layered structure of the orantes?? surfaces, microscopic samples were mounted in a polyester resin and polished in cross-section. The samples were then examined microscopically under visible and UV illumination. 
        <br />The cross-section shown here was taken from a surface suspected to have been painted over with modern paints in a past restoration. The numbered layers correspond to: (1) the original terracotta substrate, (2) the original white kaolin slip layer, (3) a suspected restoration layer consisting of calcium sulfate, (4) a restoration layer of lead white paint, (5) a restoration layer with lead white and vermilion pigment, and (6) another restoration layer of lead white paint. Knowledge of the sequence of layers helped guide conservators in the removal of restoration materials.
        </p>
        <p> Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Analysis
        <br />FTIR analysis was also conducted on a variety of different materials. This technique requires a microscopic sample and produces spectra like those shown here) based on the vibration energies of the molecular bonds. The resulting spectra can be used to identify the unknown sample through comparisons with spectra of known materials. 
        <br />The materials sampled from the orantes include: restoration adhesives, three white surface layers (each thought to be different), the substrate of the restoration fingers on the orante with arm across stomach, and the overall coating material on the orante with raised hands. Through FTIR analysis animal hide glue and shellac were identified as adhesives used in previous restorations. One white layer believed to be ancient was identified as a fine white clay called kaolin (see spectra on the left), another white layer was identified as gypsum (thought to be a restoration), and the third white layer was identified as lead white paint (also thought to be a restoration). The substrate of the restoration fingers was identified as calcium carbonate and the coating material was identified as cellulose nitrate. The presence of cellulose nitrate on the orante with raised hands likely soaked into the porous surface and helps explain the slightly darker overall appearance of its kaolin slip layer compared to that of the other orante. 
        </p>
        <p>Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)
        <br />Cross-section samples were also examined with SEM-EDS. This technique provides greater magnification and helps scientists identify and locate the elements present within a sample. The results shown here are from the same cross-section sample shown above (here at a 45??angle) and provide an elemental profile of the individual layers. At the top left is a standard SEM-EDS image in which materials composed of heavier molecular weight elements appear brighter. The other images are maps that locate where the individual elements indicated in the top left corner of each image occur within the cross- section.
